# SQL Query Practice Project

Welcome! This is your template project to practise writing SQL queries.

## Instructions

1. Run the following command first to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Open each query file in the `learner` folder (e.g. `query1.js`, `query2.js`, etc.).  
   Replace the placeholder query (`SELECT ...;`) with your own SQL solution.

3. Run each file to test your query output locally, for example:

   ```bash
   node learner/query1.js
   ```

4. Once you are satisfied with your solution, upload your project to the autograder to check if your query is correct.

Good luck, and happy learning!
